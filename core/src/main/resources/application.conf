  # All configuration keys related to the permission model
  # There are 5 predefined roles in \BlueLaTeX:
  #  - Author
  #  - Reviewer
  #  - Guest
  #  - Other
  #  - Anonymous
  # However permissions assigned to each role can be tuned for each paper.
  # The list of valid permissions is:
  #  - `edit` allows for collaboratively editing the paper,
  #  - `compile` allows for compiling the paper,
  #  - `configure` allows for configuring the paper settings like compiler settings for example (if any),
  #  - `publish` allows for using the publication feature (like creating a tag or sending to arXive),
  #  - `download` allows for downloading the source files of the paper,
  #  - `read` allows for reading the paper source but not for editing it,
  #  - `view` allows for viewing the rendered paper but not the source,
  #  - `comment` allows for commenting on a paper (either the rendered view or the source),
  #  - `chat` allows for interacting with other connected users in the chat,
  #  - `fork` allows for creating a derivative of this paper,
  #  - `change-phase` allows for changing the current phase of the paper.
